Blobs
Blob stands for Binary Large Object. Each version of a file is represented by blob. A blob holds the file data but doesnâ€™t contain any metadata about the file. It is a binary file, and in Git database, it is named as SHA1 hash of that file. In Git, files are not addressed by names. Everything is content-addressed.
